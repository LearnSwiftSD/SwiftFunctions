 ## An Advanced Use Case
 
 Let's take a look at a more advanced use case for the lowly closure. Communication
 between objects is something that is typically done through a technique called
 delegation, which takes advantage of reference symantics and protocols. However
 if you've ever tried to do this with value types you'd end up coming dry. This is
 a perfect case for closure based delegation
